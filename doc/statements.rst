Mission & Vision
==================

Here we state who we are, what we think of our work, what you can expect of
this project.

Who is behind Ghini
..............................................

Ghini started as a one-man project, by Brett Adams. He started this software
as Bauble, for and at the Belize Botanical Garden, and later on adapted it
to the needs of a couple of other users who asked him. Brett made Bauble a
commons, by releasing it under a GPL license.

After some years of stagnation Mario Frasca took responsibility of updating
Bauble, rebranded it to Ghini, in honour of Luca Ghini, started adocating,
travelling, distributing, developing, documenting it, and it is now Mario
Frasca writing this, enhancing the software, looking for users, requesting
feedback...

So currently behind Ghini there's not only one developer, but much more
importantly, a small but growing global users community.

Translations are provided by volunteers who mostly stay behind the scenes,
translating a couple of missing terms or sentences, and disappearing again.

To make things clearer when we speak of Ghini, but should—and in this
document we will—indicate whether it's Ghini(the software), or Ghini(the
people), unless obviously we mean both things.

Mission
..............................................

The Mission Statement is a purpose, it defines the rationale of an entity
and is specific and true. For Ghini, the Mission Statement sets out the
social order to which Ghini is committed, the needs that are satisfied with
Ghini(the software) and with the services of Ghini(the people), the market
in which Ghini develops and its intended public image.

Vision
..............................................

The Vision serves to indicate the way ahead and projects a future image of
what we want our organization to be, in a realistic and attractive way.  It
serves as motivation because it visualizes the challenge and direction of
necessary changes in order to grow and prosper.
