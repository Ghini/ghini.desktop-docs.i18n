representing the planned space
.................................................

Botanic gardens are mostly organized in beds and greenhouses, and larger
beds are probably organized in smaller sections, while greenhouses might be
organized in tables, shelves, walls.

In the above software view on garden data, the numeric indications at either
end of the line connecting ``Location`` and ``Planting`` tells us that every
``Planting`` can only belong to exactly one (1) ``Location``, while every
``Location`` may contain zero or more (0..n) ``Plantings``.

A consequence of this constraint in the database is that your database needs
``Locations`` in order to place ``Plants`` in the garden, so a good practice
is to start by entering a database ``Location`` for every physical bed
section, greenhouse table, or whatever might be the basic location unit in
your garden.
